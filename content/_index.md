### About

TL;DR:
I build software that helps people

Growing up, I have always been fascinated by technology that helps and entertains people, like an app that connects you with anyone in the world or a game that makes you feel like the main character in an action movie.

Over the years, I have worked on several personal and freelance projects. My specialty is creating scalable and dynamic web solutions.

I have also worked on several game projects alongside my web development contributions. I have always wanted to keep my artistic side alive, and game development serves as a bridge that connects my technical and artistic knowledge.
